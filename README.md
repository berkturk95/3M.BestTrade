# Description:

BestTrade is a platform that can enable users to buy and sell stuff like furniture, books and notes, etc. Each user will have a distinct account. Users can log in the system via their e-mail address and their desired password. In the system, users can list the stuff they want by various filtering options like search feature and checking buttons. Also, users can rate and comment each other and see the sellers' points and references. The main purpose of this project is to enable students from different universities to exchange their stuff by wasting less cost and time.
